# Mappa Linux Agent

This project provides an agentic Linux terminal assistant powered by the Google Gemini API. It can interpret your natural language requests, execute shell commands to fulfill them, and handle sudo permissions when necessary.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- An internet connection
- A Google Gemini API Key (The script is pre-configured with a key, but a custom one is recommended for extensive use).

## Deployment

To deploy and use this tool, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone or Download the Project**:
    Ensure you have the `mappa_linux.py` and `requirements.txt` files in a directory.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
    It's best practice to run Python projects in isolated environments.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required Python packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Make the Script Executable**:
    Grant execution permissions to the script.
    ```bash
    chmod +x mappa_linux.py
    ```

5.  **Run the Agent**:
    You can run the agent directly by passing your request as an argument.
    ```bash
    ./mappa_linux.py "Create a file named hello.txt with the content 'Hello World'"
    ```

    Or run it interactively:
    ```bash
    ./mappa_linux.py
    ```

6.  **Create a System-Wide Alias (Optional)**:
    To use the command `mappa` from anywhere, you can create an alias. Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:
    ```bash
    alias mappa='/path/to/your/mappa_linux.py'
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/your/mappa_linux.py` with the absolute path to the file.
    Reload your shell configuration:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
    ```

## Usage

Once setup, simply invoke the command with what you want to do:

```bash
mappa "List all files in the current directory and count lines in main.py"
```

The agent will:
1.  Analyze your request.
2.  Propose commands.
3.  Ask for sudo password if a command requires it (e.g., `sudo apt update`).
4.  Execute commands and show output.
5.  Iterate until the task is complete.

## Warning

**Security Notice**: This tool executes shell commands generated by an AI. While it is designed to be helpful, always review the commands if possible. The script currently prints "Executing: ..." before running commands.

**API Key**: The provided API Key is hardcoded for demonstration.
